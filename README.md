## API Keys

This application uses Google Maps API and MongoURI. There is an `.env.template` file in both the **server** and **client** directories that would normally be replaced with the user's personal API key. The API keys are restricted to only the Google Maps API.

It is not best practice to have API keys/DB connections hard coded, but for the sake of this challenge, I have included them already in the `.env` files.

This uses `@vis.gl/react-google-maps`, the first Google-sponsored React library for Google Maps. It's still in the **Alpha** version.
